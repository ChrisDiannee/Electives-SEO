			<h2>Difference between ON-PAGE and OFF-PAGE SEO</h2>
			<p>

				On-Page SEO refers to how well your website’s content is presented to search engines. On page optimization involves ensuring whether a particular webpage is structured in a manner so that it gets found by the search engines for given keywords and key phrases. 
                        
			</p>
			<p> 
				
				While Off-Page SEO refers to your website’s overall “authority” on the web determined by what other websites say about your site. Off-page optimization is a long-term process and takes the time to improve.

			<h2>SEO guides for ON-PAGE technique</h2>
			<ul>			
			<li>USE SEO-FRIENDLY URLS
			<p>
				Google has stated that the first 3-5 words in a URL are given more weight.So make your URLs short and sweet.And always include your target keyword in your URL.</p>

			</li>
			<br><li>START TITLE WITH KEYWORD
				<p>Your title tag is the most important on-page SEO factor.In general, the closer the keyword is to the beginning of the title tag, the more weight it has with search engines.</p>

			</li>
			<br><li>ADD MODIFIERS TO YOUR TITLE
				<p>Using modifiers like “2017”, “best”, “guide”, and “review” can help you rank for long tail versions of your target keyword.</p>


			</li>
			<br><li>WRAP YOUR BLOG POST TITLE IN AN H1 TAG
				<p>The H1 tag is your “headline tag”. Most CMS’s (like WordPress) automatically add the H1 tag to your blog post title. If that’s the case, you’re all set.But some themes override this setting. Check your site’s code to make sure your title gets the H1 love it deserves.</p>

			</li>
			<br><li>DAZZLE WITH MULTIMEDIA
				<p>Text can only take your content so far. Engaging images, videos and diagrams can reduce bounce rate and increase time on site: two critical user interaction ranking factors.</p>
			</li>
			<br><li>WRAP SUBHEADINGS IN H2 TAGS
				<p>Include your target keyword in at least once subheading…and wrap it in an H2 tag.</p>
			</li>

			<br><li>DROP KEYWORDS IN FIRST 100 WORDS

				<p>Your keyword should appear in the first 100-150 words of your article.</p>
			</li>
			<br><li>USE RESPONSIVE DESIGN
				<p>Google started penalizing mobile unfriendly sites in 2015. And they’re likely crack down even more in the future. If you want to make your site mobile-friendly, I recommend Responsive Design.</p>
			</li>
			<br><li>USE OUTBOUND LINKS
				<p>Outbound links to related pages helps Google figure out your page’s topic. It also shows Google that your page is a hub of quality info.</p>
			</li>
			<br><li>USE INTERNAL LINKS
				<p>Internal linking is SO money. Use 2-3 in every post.</p>

			</li>
			<br><li>BOOST SITE SPEED
				<p>Google has stated on the record that page loading speed is an SEO ranking signal. You can boost your site speed by using a CDN, compressing images, and switching to faster hosting.Make sure your site doesn’t take more than 4 seconds to load: MunchWeb found that 75% of users wouldn’t re-visit a site that took longer than 4 seconds to load.</p>

			</li>
			<br><li>SPRINKLE LSI KEYWORDS
				<p>LSI keywords are synonyms that Google uses to determine a page’s relevancy (and possibly quality). Sprinkle them into every post.</p>

			</li>
			<br><li>IMAGE OPTIMIZATION
				<p>Make sure at least one image file name includes your target keyword (for example, on_page_SEO.png) and that your target keyword is part of your image Alt Text.</p>

			</li>
			<br><li>USE SOCIAL SHARING BUTTONS

				<p>Social signals may not play a direct role in ranking your site. But social shares generate more eyeballs on your content.And the more eyeballs you get, the more likely someone is to link to you. So don’t be shy about placing social sharing buttons prominently on your site.In fact, a study by BrightEdge found that prominent social sharing buttons can increase social sharing by 700%.
</p>

			</li>
			<br><li>POST LONG CONTENT
				<p>The SEO adage “length is strength” was supported by our industry study which found that longer content tends to rank significantly higher on Google’s first page.</p>
			</li>
			<br><li>BOOST DWELL TIME
				<p>If someone hits their back button immediately after landing on a page, it tells Google in black-and-white: this is low quality page.That’s why Google uses “dwell time” to size up your content’s quality. Increase your average dwell time by writing long, engaging content that keeps people reading.</p>
